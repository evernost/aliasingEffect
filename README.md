# aliasingEffect
Deep dive into a controlled aliasing effect, and explore the consequences in realtime.

## TODO / ideas

- [ ] add the possibility (somehow) to sync the upper aliasing frequency with the fundamental, thus preserving the spectrum when the fundamental changes.
- [ ] add an envelope generator for the amplitude
- [ ] read MIDI inputs (if possible)
